Here you can find 12 dataset. Actually the data is collecetd over the period from 6th october 2016 to 4th october 2021.

but later we decided to work with data after 23rd March 2020 { when there was Lock down due to covid } 

oct_it  is the data after 4th october 2021 to 29th october 2021 , this is collected later to compare our model's prediction.


So, you  can find which dataset is used in the codes.

The final dataset after concatinatining all is named as ( in case of NIFTY-IT) It_data which is actually made by concatinating it_data and oct_it.
you can get it now.
